# Getting started with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework for production. It has been developed by the team at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

While React, on its own, is understood to be a Library and not a full framework. Next.js provides an actual framework for React with many cool features.

## Features

These features include:

- File-based Routing
- Built-in Page Pre-rendering
